# Random Forest
We can observe that the random forest model and bagging have high accuracy to predict the values of diagnosis. I used different evaluation methods to check on the accuracy such as cross validation, confusion matrix and ROC curve. All of these prove that random forest model and bagging model predict the values of test data with higher accuracy.
